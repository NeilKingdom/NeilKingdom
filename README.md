### About

I am a passionate and hard-working graduate of the Computer Engineering Technology program at Algonquin College, seeking to learn new technologies and sharpen my skills with people who share the same interests as me.
I love to create new things, whether they be programs or hands-on projects. If you'd like to see some of the work I've been doing lately, check out my pinned repositories below! ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡
